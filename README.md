**Why monorepo?** :pencil2:

Having considered a few different approaches, i.e. multiple repos, orphan branches or submodules, I've decided on monorepo for CRUD-related projects:

* Projects listed here are developed independently but with the same purpose in mindâ€“â€“learning. Monorepo lets me organise my knowledge base, categorise it by type/methodology/etc. while maintaining unrelated character of projects
* Orphan branches are a bit too unusual--meaning, having limited time, viewers are less likely to acknowledge {i++} branches
* Personal preference of not having {i++} unmaintained repos
* Submodules would be a nearly perfect, elegant solution, unless projects were actively supported
